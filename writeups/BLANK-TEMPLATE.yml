# FORMATTING TIPS:
# ============================================================
#
# - Use <strong>text</strong> for bold
# - Use 2 spaces for indentation (YAML requirement)
# - Use | after "code:" for multi-line code blocks
# - Delete sections you don't need
# - Copy-paste section types as needed
#
# FILE NAMING:
# - Use lowercase with hyphens
# - Good: 03-phishing-analysis.yml
# - Bad: Phishing Analysis.yml
